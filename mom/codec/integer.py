:module: mom.codec.integer
:synopsis: Routines for converting between integers and bytes.

Number-bytes conversion
-----------------------
These codecs are "lossy" as they don't preserve prefixed padding zero bytes.
In a more mathematical sense,

    ``g(f(x))`` is **almost** an identity function, but not exactly.

where ``g`` is the decoder and ``f`` is a encoder.
